    <p>In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: 
        no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.
        <br> <br>
        In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that 
        we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is finishedâ€”one poem is abandoned, 
        another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, 
        but it is the ending of a poem without an end.
