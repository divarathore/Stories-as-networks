    <p>Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone
         is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. 
        This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that we 
        each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That sentence begins with your first words, 
        toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, 
        or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone 
        who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.
        <br> <br>
        When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” 
        he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, 
        but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) 
        you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a 
        matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated.
