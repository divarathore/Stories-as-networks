    <p>Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this: 
        “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be 
        involved in all our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created 
        are also released. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those 
        expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”
        <br> <br>
        But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. How can the origin be traced when there 
        is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go 
        back to a nanosecond before the beginning, before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the 
        precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born.
