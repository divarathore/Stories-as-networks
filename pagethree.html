    <p>In the beginning was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. 
        And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. 
        that nothing can precede actionâ€”no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act.
